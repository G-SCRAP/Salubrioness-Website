                         We Strive to help the world's overall health in these main categories:
                         <br>
                         <br>
                        Exercising: Exercise helps people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases. Exercising regularly lowers a person's risk of developing some diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Exercise also can help keep your body at a healthy weight.
                        <br>   
                        <br>
                        Sleep: Sleep plays an important role in your physical health. For example, sleep is involved in healing and repair of your heart and blood vessels. 
                        Ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Dieting: A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Mental Health: <q>Mental Health is the key to success</q> - Gavin Ogren
                        Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
